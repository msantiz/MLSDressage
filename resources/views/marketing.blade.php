<div class = "bigbox">

<div class = "box">
<center><font size = "5" face = "roboto" color = "white"><p>My name is Mara Santiz and I am 26 years old. I
graduated from the University of Michigan-Dearborn in 2019, and
started my career as an Information Technology Ford
College Graduate at Ford Motor Company.
I received a promotion in December 2020 and became a Product Manager- Specialist.
In April, I accepted a position at Canopy, a joint venture between Ford and ADT.</p>
<p>During my time as a full-time student, I gave new meaning
to the idea of hard work. While completing 18 hours of
coursework per semester, I also worked four jobs to
support my horse-related goals. I was a math tutor,
a riding instructor, a barn manager, and a substitute
teacher. Even now, I have started my own web design business and
I still teach riding lessons, all while working my full-time job at Canopy.
I am also pursuing an MBA, with plans to graduate in 2023.</p>
<p>My horse, Ferdinand, has had to retire due to an old injury
he sustained before I purchased him. I spend over an hour
each day caring for him and making sure he receives his medications.
Luckily, I have been able to ride several
horses for other people which has improved my riding ability
tremendously.</p>
<p>Last spring I was able to purchase a young horse with upper-level
potential, and my goal is to compete for the U.S. Olympic team with
him one day. The Equestrian sport is an untapped market for
many businesses, and I believe with my strong ties to the
industry, I can help companies to enter this lucrative market.
According to the recent National Economic Impact Study,
over 4.6 billion people are involved in the Equestrian industry,
and the industry contributes $122 billion to the U.S. economy each year.
Pairing a future international athlete with your company would be
a great way to tap into that market. I have worked hard and
sacrificed many things to become a rising star in the Dressage
industry, and intend to show the world what I can do now that
I have begun training my new equine partner. This summer I plan
to compete the USDF Four-Year-Old dressage test.</p>
<p>I embody the values of commitment and excellence, and am a very
reliable and loyal person. I am also highly motivated and
innovative, and I always persevere. I would
ask that you consider partnering with me, with the hope that we
can bring these values to the Equestrian community.</p>
<p>If you would like to discuss anything about the Equestrian
community, Dressage, my journey, or your company's future role
in my success, please feel free to contact me.</p>
